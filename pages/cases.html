  # Take a look at some of the other fraud cases the Texas Mutual-funded prosecutors have pursued

  <p class="author">Austin American-Statesman and The Texas Tribune / Published Sept. 8, 2015</p>

	Texas Mutual Insurance Company and the Travis County district attorney’s office say their long-existing financial agreement benefits Texas businesses by cutting down on costly fraud. <a name="ramco"></a>But critics claim this relationship puts too much power in the hands of a single private company. Here are some cases Texas Mutual has touted in press releases as big wins — but which defense attorneys and critics say were unfairly prosecuted.

	## RAMCO

	Texas Mutual alleged the small trucking company based in Vidor in Southeast Texas was improperly paying lower premiums by classifying some drivers as independent owners and operators.

	In 2013, a jury found the company guilty of workers’ compensation fraud. Ramco paid $15,567 in restitution to Texas Mutual and a $15,000 fine and court costs.

	Yet attorneys and experts who testified for the company say the case is an example of how Texas Mutual treats simple legal misunderstandings as criminal cases.

	Betty Blackwell, Ramco’s lawyer, said her client believed it was legal to not offer workers’ compensation insurance to its truck drivers because they were independent contractors who had private insurance. Dennis Templeton, Ramco’s insurance agent, said the contractors shouldn’t have been counted in premium calculations because Texas Mutual wasn’t liable for any injuries they incurred.

	Templeton also noted that Ramco’s previous provider of workers’ compensation insurance, AIG, had raised similar concerns but dropped the matter after Ramco explained its business structure.

	Texas Mutual and Travis County’s prosecution of the same issue “was a farce,” he said. “If it were any other insurance company in the United States, that would not have been a criminal proceeding.”

	Tim Riley, head of investigations at Texas Mutual, said his company “didn’t influence anyone” to obtain the guilty verdict.

	## GLENDA HOWELL

	In 2014, Texas Mutual brought fraud charges against G&M Construction, a road repair company, and owner Glenda Howell for allegedly misrepresenting the company’s operations and payroll. The company pleaded guilty and paid court costs of $224 and a $50 fine. The case against Howell was dismissed when she paid restitution to Texas Mutual.

	Howell did not return phone calls, and her attorney, Frank Bryan, declined comment. But workers’ compensation attorney Brad McClellan, who is familiar with the case, said it represented a legal strategy in which the Travis DA indicts both individuals and a corporate entity as a tactic to leverage restitution payments to Texas Mutual.

	McClellan said in these scenarios the individual who gets indicted often concludes it’s not worth spending thousands of dollars on legal fees and instead will settle for a negotiated amount of restitution.

	Texas Mutual declined to comment.

	## MARK HELM

	Texas Mutual alleged in a press release that Mark Helm, owner of a construction company, falsely listed subcontractors as contract laborers, which allowed him to pay lower premiums. Helm pleaded guilty to receiving workers’ compensation insurance under false pretenses as part of a deal and paid more than $227,000 in restitution to Texas Mutual. He was placed on eight years of probation.

	Helms’ attorney, Sam Bassett, said the criminal case centered on the gray area of whether certain subcontractors should be classified as employees. He said that Texas Mutual and the DA’s office are criminalizing a widespread practice in the construction industry and that other counties are leaving the matter to civil courts to resolve.

	“I think it’s a little unusual in the sense of one insurance company is the one we’re always dealing with,” he said. “I can’t imagine this isn’t an issue on every construction project in Texas.”

	Texas Mutual said fraud by use of subcontractors can cause “great harm” to workers and the industry and the grand jury “appears to have agreed with us.”

	## LARRY WALLACE

	Larry Wallace, an insurance broker, was accused of “making false statements” to Texas Mutual about the number of workers employed by a construction company he sold policies to, which had the effect of decreasing the amount in premiums his client had to pay.

	In a request to have the case dismissed, Wallace’s lawyer, Janet Prueitt, accused Donna Crosby, the prosecutor who heads the Texas Mutual-funded unit, of intentionally withholding evidence and insisting her client provide an interview without an attorney present, in violation of Wallace’s right to counsel. A judge did not grant the request.

	But the jury believed Wallace when he said he’d only been making a good-faith effort to help his client save money using common, legal business structures. He was found not guilty.

	“There was no intent on his part to defraud anybody,” Prueitt said.
