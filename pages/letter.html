  # The Kyees case: Lawyers weigh in

  <p class="author">Austin American-Statesman and The Texas Tribune / Published Sept. 9, 2015</p>

	The case against Roy Kyees came down to a single slip of paper: A Nov. 13, 2006 letter from Kyees’ attorneys informing Texas Mutual Insurance that their client had returned to work. Once the prosecutor was provided a copy of the letter, the charges were dropped. Yet almost nine years later, both sides are still fighting about the document’s authenticity. Here’s what they had to say in statements to The Texas Tribune and the Austin American-Statesman:

	## Full written statement from Texas Mutual General Counsel Mary Nichols:

	“Texas Mutual referred Mr. Kyees to the district attorney because Texas Mutual had a reasonable belief, based on information supplied by Mr. Kyees’s former employer, that insurance fraud might have occurred. The district attorney initially agreed, as did the grand jury. In Mr. Kyees’s case, the later decision to dismiss the charges was that of the district attorney, who has the responsibility of deciding whether to pursue prosecution.

	“After Mr. Kyees was arrested for insurance fraud in 2008, his workers compensation lawyer gave the district attorney a letter dated Nov. 13, 2006, purportedly sent to Texas Mutual on that date, that informed Texas Mutual that Mr. Kyees had returned to work on Aug. 16, 2006. Multiple Texas Mutual employees conducted an exhaustive search of our claim files for this letter.

	“Texas Mutual has found no indication whatsoever that the letter was ever received.

	“The copy of the letter presented to the district attorney in 2008 also lacked any evidence of delivery, such as fax and email notations, which would have usually been present. Mr. Kyees’s lawyer’s billing records do not reflect any efforts made to notify Texas Mutual that he had returned to work.

	“Under questioning, Mr. Kyees’s lawyer said that he could not supply any confirmation of when the letter was prepared or that the letter was actually sent because, after a ‘virus attack,’ his office ‘wiped’ his computer ‘clean’ of any relevant data. He said that his office then ‘rebooted’ it and it continued to function for a while, but in 2008 it was ‘sent off to the shredder.’ Texas Mutual therefore had no opportunity to examine the facts surrounding the purported transmittal.

	“The letter purportedly sent from Mr. Kyees’s lawyer also failed to inform Texas Mutual of the amount of earnings from the new employer, even though the law requires disclosure of this information so that benefits checks can be adjusted to the correct amount.

	“But even if Texas Mutual had received the letter on Nov. 13, 2006 (three months after Mr. Kyees started working a new job) Mr. Kyees nonetheless continued to cash the weekly disability checks while working another job. Every check he got warned on its face that he must notify his adjuster if he received any income after his injury. Mr. Kyees was also represented by a lawyer during that time — the same lawyer who also defended Mr. Kyees in the criminal case and who produced the letter after Mr. Kyees’s indictment.

	“It thus appears that Mr. Kyees had every opportunity to do the right thing, but for whatever reason he chose to keep the disability checks. That consequences might result was clear all along.”

	## Response from Kyees lawyer Mark Cevallos based on interviews:

	In an interview, Cevallos called Texas Mutual’s claim that it conducted an “exhaustive search” for his firm’s 2006 letter about Kyees’ return to work a direct contradiction of Texas Mutual’s sworn court testimony.

	“This is the first time TMI has ever come close to saying they searched for the letter,’’ Cevallos said. “Their own designated representative testified in his deposition that he never looked through the entire file.”

	Cevallos was referring to the sworn deposition from Terry Eliasen, whom Texas Mutual designated as its official spokesman in Kyees’ malicious prosecution case against the company.

	In his testimony, Eliasen said: “I have not reviewed the claim file to see if the letter is in there.’’

	The allegation that the company did not make a diligent search to find the letter was a centerpiece of Kyees’ malicious prosecution lawsuit against Texas Mutual. During that battle, Cevallos said Texas Mutual made a “reasonable request” for computer records that might have produced an electronic copy of the Nov. 13, 2006, letter, but no such records existed by the time they asked for it — years later. He said the letter was prepared on a computer before the firm got remote cloud storage and fell prey to a virus that wiped out the hard drive.

	Cevallos said he and two other partners in his firm all vouched to the existence of the letter. He said if he and his partners were lying about it they could open themselves up to serious criminal charges and disbarment.

	“They’re trying to argue that we made up this letter. They didn’t do that when we are in the suit. They didn’t do that a week from trial when they were offering us money to settle the case,’’ he said. “They wait until a newspaper reporter starts digging around. Nothing Texas Mutual does surprises me, but it’s just silly.”

	Cevallos pointed out that Kyees, his wife, Teresa, and lawyer Royce Bicklein all testified under oath that they made a follow-up phone call to Texas Mutual after the letter was sent and left word that Kyees had returned to work.

	Kyees testified under oath that he notified Texas Mutual that it had sent him too much money when he got a lump sum check in November. His attorneys described their recommendation to him as a no-brainer: Kyees was still deemed eligible to receive benefits for his impairment — even if he had a new job. He was still entitled to weekly income.

	Cevallos said Texas Mutual had made what was known as a “gratuitous overpayment,” not an uncommon occurrence, and the company, following typical protocol in such case, could simply lower the amount it was paying him weekly. They still had an ongoing dispute over the extent of the injury, so benefits could go up or down.

	His lawyers told Kyees to cash the checks, and he did.
